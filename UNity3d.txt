Unity Overview

Unity3D is a free game development tool that allows you to create visually rich games in an 
easy to work IDE. It runs on javascript and C# so it would be perfect for what we would want
to do. If you dont want to do javascript, c# is essentially the same as java, just a few
different naming conventions and such. If you already ahve the server, I will provide a tutorial
on how to write a script to connect a game to the server and how it is done using unity. 

Unity will allow us to not only write code, but also provides a drag and drop screen if we want
to make the game aesthetically pleasing and we wont have to worry about making it, then debugging 
it to make sure things end up in the correct place. Its all in real time. TO give you a demo, i'll
send you a link to a game that I have helped someone build as a part of the Game Development Club 
that I am in(might have to show you this later as I dont currently have the updated link). 

This is a link to a description of how a guy created a card game in unity3D:

This is a link to a tutorial on how to make a game available as an online game using a server:

If we ever wanted to import video into the game, we could do it relatvely easily using this:

Unity3D is for Mac and Windows so we wont run into any issues there either, it is also free.
